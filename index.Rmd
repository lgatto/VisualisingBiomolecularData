# Introduction

This *Visualisation of biomolecular data* course was set up as part of
the 2018 edition of the May Institute *Computation and statistics for
mass spectrometry and proteomics* at Northeastern University, Boston
MA. It is aimed at people who are already familiar with the R language
and syntax, and who would like to get a hands-on introduction to
visualisation, with a focus on biomolecular data in general, and
proteomics in particular. This course is meant to be mostly hands-on,
with an intuitive understanding of the underlying techniques.

Let's use the famous
[*Anscombe's quartet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)
data as a motivating example. This data is composed of 4 pairs of
values, $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_4, y_4)$:

```{r anscombe, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library("knitr")
kable(anscombe)
```

Each of these $x$ and $y$ sets have the same variance, mean and
correlation:

```{r anscombetab, echo=FALSE}
tab <- matrix(NA, 5, 4)
colnames(tab) <- 1:4
rownames(tab) <- c("var(x)", "mean(x)",
				   "var(y)", "mean(y)",
				   "cor(x,y)")

for (i in 1:4)
	tab[, i] <- c(var(anscombe[, i]),
				  mean(anscombe[, i]),
				  var(anscombe[, i+4]),
				  mean(anscombe[, i+4]),
				  cor(anscombe[, i], anscombe[, i+4]))

```

```{r anstabdisplay, echo=FALSE}
kable(tab)
```

But...

While the *residuals* of the linear regression clearly indicate
fundamental differences in these data, the most simple and
straightforward approach is *visualisation* to highlight the
fundamental differences in the datasets.

```{r anscombefig, echo=FALSE}
ff <- y ~ x

mods <- setNames(as.list(1:4), paste0("lm", 1:4))

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
for (i in 1:4) {
	ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
	plot(ff, data = anscombe, pch = 19, xlim = c(3, 19), ylim = c(3, 13))
	mods[[i]] <- lm(ff, data = anscombe)
	abline(mods[[i]])
}
```

We will focus on producing visualisation that will enable
**understanding important features** of biomolecular data or the
effect of their transformation and analyses. With this in mind, the
beauty of the visualisations we will produce won't be assessed by how
visually attractive the figures are, but how they help us understand
the data. In the process of data exploration and data analysis, we
want to be able to quickly generate and interpret figures, to progress
in our understanding. It is of course important to fine tune the
graphics to make them visually appealing and improve communication
with the audience, but we won't focus on these aspects here.

An important aspect of data visualisation is data **manipulation**,
transformation and the format of the data. These topics will be
introduced and documented throughout the course.

A last feature of data that is intimately associated with its
manipulation and visualisation is its **structure**. Some
visualisations will be much easier if the data is formatted in a
certain way. As such, we will describe different formats (long, wide)
and data structures (dataframes and more specialised data structure).
