# Interactive visualisation

## Interactivity graphs

> This section is based on the on-line [`ggvis` documentation](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/)

The goal of ggvis is to make it easy to build interactive graphics for
exploratory data analysis. [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/) has a
similar underlying theory to `ggplot2` (the grammar of graphics), but
it's expressed a little differently, and adds new features to make
your plots interactive. [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/) also
incorporates shiny's reactive programming model (see later) and
`dplyr`'s grammar of data transformation.

```{r ggvis1, eval = FALSE}
library("ggvis")
sml <- sample(nrow(surveys_complete), 1e3)
surveys_sml <- surveys_complete[sml, ]
```

```{r ggvis2, eval = FALSE}
p <- ggvis(surveys_sml, x = ~weight, y = ~hindfoot_length)
p %>% layer_points()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
surveys_sml %>%
	ggvis(x = ~weight, y = ~hindfoot_length,
		  fill = ~species_id) %>%
	layer_points()
```

```{r ggvis3, eval = FALSE}
p %>% layer_points(fill = ~species_id)
p %>% layer_points(shape = ~species_id)
```

To set fixed plotting parameters, use `:=`.

```{r ggvis4, eval = FALSE}
p %>% layer_points(fill := "red", stroke := "black")
p %>% layer_points(size := 300, opacity := 0.4)
p %>% layer_points(shape := "cross")
```

### Interactivity {-}

```{r ggvis5, eval = FALSE}
p %>% layer_points(
		  size := input_slider(10, 100),
		  opacity := input_slider(0, 1))
```

```{r ggvis6, eval = FALSE}
p %>%
	layer_points() %>%
	add_tooltip(function(df) df$weight)
```

* `input_slider()`
* `input_checkbox()`
* `input_checkboxgroup()`
* `input_numeric()`
* `input_radiobuttons()`
* `input_select()`
* `input_text()`

See the
[interactivity vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/interactivity.html)
for details.


### Layers {-}

**Simple layers**

* `layer_points()`, with properties x, y, shape, stroke, fill,
  strokeOpacity, fillOpacity, and opacity.
* `layer_paths()`, for paths and polygons (using the fill argument).
* `layer_ribbons()` for filled areas.
* `layer_rects()`, `layer_text()`.

**Compound layers**, which which combine data transformations with one
or more simple layers.

* `layer_lines()` which automatically orders by the x variable with
  `arrange()`.
* `layer_histograms()` and `layer_freqpolys()`, which first bin the
  data with `compute_bin()`.
* `layer_smooths()`, which fits and plots a smooth model to the data
  using `compute_smooth()`.

See the [layers vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/layers.html) for
details.


Like for `ggplot2`'s geoms, we can overly multiple layers:


```{r ggvis7, eval = FALSE}
p %>%
	layer_points() %>%
	layer_smooths(stroke := "red")
```

### More components{-}

* `scales`, to control the mapping between data and visual properties;
  see the
  [properties and scales vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/properties-scales.html).

* `legends` and `axes` to control the appearance of the guides
  produced by the scales. See the
  [axes and legends vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/axes-legends.html).

## Interactive apps

## Motivating examples {-}

In this section, we show how to build interactive `shiny`
applications. `shiny` is widely used to explore and visualise
biomolecular data. As motivating examples, we present here two such
example for proteomics data.

### Longitudinal proteomics QC


### Spatial proteomics {-}

The `Biocpkg("pRoloc")` package offers dedicated functionality to
manipulate, annotate, analyse and visualise spatial proteomics
data. Its companion package `Biocpkg("pRolocGUI")` offers support for
interactive visualisation.

You can start an app to visualise one of the published data as shown below

```{r hyperlopit, eval = FALSE}
library("pRoloc")
library("pRolocdata")
data(hyperLOPIT2015)
library("pRolocGUI")
pRolocVis(hyperLOPIT2015)
```

This same data is also available as a standalone on-line application:


```{r pRolocGUI, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://lgatto.shinyapps.io/christoforou2015/",
				   height = "650px")
```


### Introduction {-}

> This section is based on RStudio `shiny` tutorials.

From the [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
package [website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/):

> Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web
> apps straight from R.

When using [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), one tends to aim for
more complete, long-lasting applications, rather then *simply* and
transient visualisations.

A [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application is composed of a
*ui* (user interface) and a *server* that exchange information using a
programming paradigm called *reactive programming*: changes performed
by the user to the *ui* trigger a reaction by the *server* and the
output is updated accordingly.

- In the ui: define the components of the user interface (such as page
  layout, page title, input options and outputs), i.e what the user
  will see and interact with.

- In the server: defines the computations in the R backend.

- The *reactive* programming is implemented through *reactive*
  functions, which are functions that are only called when their
  respective inputs are changed.

- An application is run with the `shiny::runApp()` function, which
  takes the directory containing the two files as input.

Before looking at the details of such an architecture, let's build a
simple example from scratch, step by step. This app, shown below, uses
the `faithful` data, describing the wainting time between eruptions
and the duration of the reuption for the Old Faithful geyser in
Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

```{r faithfuldata}
head(faithful)
```

It shows the distribution of waiting times along a histogram (produced
by the `hist` function) and provides a slider to adjust the number of
bins (the `breaks` argument to `hist`).

```{r shinyapp1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://lgatto.shinyapps.io/shiny-app1/",
				   height = "650px")
```

The app can also be opened at https://lgatto.shinyapps.io/shiny-app1/


### Creation of our fist shiny app {-}

1. Create a directory that will contain the app, such as for example
   `"shinyapp"`.
2. In this directory, create the *ui* and *server* files, named `ui.R`
   and `server.R`.
3. In the `ui.R` file, let's defines a (fluid) page containing
   - a title panel with a page title;
   - a layout containing a sidebar and a main panel

```{r ui00, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app00/ui.R'))
```

4. In the `server.R` file, we define the `shinyServer` function that
   handles input and ouputs (none at this stage) and the R logic.

```{r server00, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app00/server.R'))
```

5. Let's now add some items to the *ui*: a text input widget in the
   sidebar and a field to hold the text ouput.

```{r ui01, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app01/ui.R'))
```

6. In the `server.R` file, we add in the `shinyServer` function some R
   code defining how to manipulate the user-provided text and render
   it using a shiny `textOuput`.

```{r server01, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app01/server.R'))
```

7. Let's now add a plot in the main panel in `ui.R` and some code to
   draw a histogram in `server.R`:

```{r ui02, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app02/ui.R'))
```

```{r server02, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app02/server.R'))
```

8. We want to be able to control the number of breaks used to plot the
   histograms. We first add a `sliderInput` to the *ui* for the user
   to specify the number of bins, and then make use of that new input
   to parametrise the histogram.

```{r ui03, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app03/ui.R'))
```

```{r server03, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app03/server.R'))
```

9. The next addition is to add a menu for the user to choose a set of
   predefined colours (that would be a `selectInput`) in the `ui.R`
   file and use that new input to parametrise the colour of the
   histogramme in the `server.R` file.

```{r ui04, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app04/ui.R'))
```

```{r server04, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines('src/shiny-app04/server.R'))
```

10. The last addition that we want is to visualise the actual data in
   the main panel. We add a `dataTableOutput` in `ui.R` and generate
   that table in `server.R` using a `renderDataTable` rendering
   function.

```{r ui1, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app1/ui.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

```{r server1, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app1/server.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

### The shiny infrastructure {-}

The overview figure below is based and makes reference to lessons of
the [written tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).

![](./img/shiny-overview.jpg)

### Another shiny app {-}

```{r shinyapp2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://lgatto.shinyapps.io/shiny-app2/",
				   height = "650px")
```

The *ui* uses the `fluidPage` UI and a sidebar layout. The sidebar
panel contains a `textInput` with a caption, a `selectInput` to choose
from the three possible datasets `rock`, `pressure` or `cars`, and a
`numericInput` to define how many observations to show.

The main panel use a `textOutput` to display the caption, a
`verbatimOutput` to show the output of the `summary` function on the
data chosen in the `selectInput` above, and a `tableOutput` to show
the head of that same data.

```{r ui2, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app2/ui.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

The *server* defines a `reactive` expression that sets the appropriate
data based on the `selectInput` above. It produces three outputs:

1. the caption using `renderText` and the caption defined above;
2. the appropriate summary using `renderPrint` and the reactive data;
3. the table using `renderTable` to produce the head with the reactive
   data and number of observations defined by the `numbericInput`
   above.

```{r server2, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app2/server.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

> Challenge

> Using the code above, implement and run the app.

### Single-file app {-}

Instead of defining the *ui* and *server* in their respective files,
they can be combined into list to be passed directly to `runApp`:

```{r singlefileapp, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(...)
server <- function(input, output) { ... }

app <- list(ui = ui, server = server)
runApp(app)
```
