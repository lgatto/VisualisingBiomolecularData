Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to
read, especially for complicated operations. Enter
**`dplyr`**. **`dplyr`** is a package for making tabular data
manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables
you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and
analysis.

We will need the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
package. This is an "umbrella-package" that installs several packages
useful for data analysis which work together well such as `dplyr`,
`ggplot2` (for visualisation), `tibble`, etc.

```{r tidyverse}
library("tidyverse")
```
The `tidyverse` package tries to address 3 major problems with some of
base R functions:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depends on the type of
   data.
2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing
   for new learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are
   not aware of.


To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**, you may want to check
out this [handy data transformation with **`dplyr`**
cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
and this [one about
**`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

Let's start by reading the data using `readr::read_csv` that will
produce a `tibble`.

```{r readiprg,results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
library("readr")
iprg <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/VisBiomedDataIprgCsv")
```

Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some of the old behaviors of
data frames. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For
our purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its
   name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many
   columns as fit on one screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:
`select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and
`summarize()`. To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The
first argument to this function is the data frame, and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r selectiprg, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(iprg, Protein, Run, Condition)
```
To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r filteriprg, purl = FALSE}
filter(iprg, BioReplicate == 1)
```

```{r filteriprg2, purl = FALSE}
filter(iprg, Condition == 'Condition2')
```

## Pipes

But what if you wanted to select and filter at the same time? There
are three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions,
or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you essentially create a temporary data frame
and use that as input to the next function. This can clutter up your
workspace with lots of objects. You can also nest functions (i.e. one
function inside of another).  This is handy, but can be difficult to
read if too many functions are nested as things are evaluated from the
inside out.

The last option, pipes, are a fairly recent addition to R. Pipes let
you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next,
which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset.
Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr`
package, installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio,
you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

```{r pipes}
iprg %>%
  filter(Intensity > 1e8) %>%
  select(Protein, Condition, Intensity)
```

In the above, we use the pipe to send the `iprg` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `Intensity` is greater than 1e8, then
through `select()` to keep only the `Protein`, `Condition`, and
`Intensity` columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and
passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don't
need to explicitly include it as an argument to the `filter()` and
`select()` functions anymore.

If we wanted to create a new object with this smaller version of the
data, we could do so by assigning it a new name:

```{r pipes2}
iprg_sml <- iprg %>%
	filter(Intensity > 1e8) %>%
	select(Protein, Condition, Intensity)

iprg_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer
iprg %>%
	filter(Log2Intensity > 20) %>%
	select(Protein, Condition)
```

## Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r mutate1}
iprg %>%
  mutate(Log10Intensity = log10(Intensity))
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column
within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r mutate2}
iprg %>%
	mutate(Log10Intensity = log10(Intensity),
		   Log10Intensity2 = Log10Intensity * 2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few
rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work
with non-**`dplyr`** functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or
`magrittr` package is loaded).

```{r mutate3}
iprg %>%
  mutate(Log10Intensity = log10(Intensity)) %>%
  head
```

Note that we don't include parentheses at the end of our call to `head()` above.
When piping into a function with no additional arguments, you can call the
function with or without parentheses (e.g. `head` or `head()`).

If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number
of rows to display:


```{r mutate4}
iprg %>%
	mutate(Log10Intensity = log10(Intensity),
			   Log10Intensity2 = Log10Intensity * 2) %>%
	print(n = 20)
```

Let's use a modified `iprg` data that contains missing values for the
next example. It can be loaded with

```{r downlaodiprgna}
if (!file.exists("./data/iprgna.rda"))
	download.file("http://bit.ly/VisBiomedDataIprgNA",
				  "./data/iprgna.rda")
load("./data/iprgna.rda")
```

> `Log10Intensisty` column.

<details>
```{r}
iprgna %>% mutate(Log10Intensity = log10(Intensity))
```
</details>

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove
those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r filtermutiprg}
iprgna %>%
	filter(!is.na(Intensity)) %>%
	mutate(Log10Intensity = log10(Intensity))
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an
`NA`. The `!` symbol negates the result, so we're asking for
everything that *is not* an `NA`.

## Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`**
makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.


### The `summarize()` function {-}

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which
collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group.
`group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the
**categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary
statistics. So to view the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r group1}
iprgna %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  summarize(mean_Intensity = mean(Intensity))
```

Unfortunately, the `mean` of any vector that contains even a single
missing value is `NA`. We need to remove missing values before
calculating the mean, which is done easily with the `na.rm` argument.

```{r group2}
iprgna %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  summarize(mean_Intensity = mean(Intensity, na.rm = TRUE))
```


You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r group3}
iprgna %>%
  group_by(TechReplicate, BioReplicate) %>%
  summarize(mean_Intensity = mean(Intensity, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Tallying {-}

When working with data, it is also common to want to know the number of
observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this, **`dplyr`**
provides `tally()`.

```{r tally}
iprgna %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  tally
```

Here, `tally()` is the action applied to the groups created by `group_by()` and
counts the total number of records for each category.

```{r}
## Answer 1
iprgna %>%
	group_by(TechReplicate) %>%
	tally

## Answer 2
iprgna %>%
	filter(!is.na(Intensity)) %>%
	group_by(Condition) %>%
	summarize(mean_int = mean(Intensity),
				  min_int = min(Intensity),
				  max_int = max(Intensity))

## Answer 3
iprgna %>%
	filter(!is.na(Intensity)) %>%
	group_by(Condition) %>%
	filter(Intensity == max(Intensity)) %>%
	arrange(Intensity)
```
