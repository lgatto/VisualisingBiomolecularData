# Example datasets

## CRC training data

This dataset comes from the `r Biocexptpkg("MSstatsBioData")` package
and was generated as follows:

```{r crctrain, eval = FALSE}
library("MSstats")
library("MSstatsBioData")
data(SRM_crc_training)
Quant <- dataProcess(SRM_crc_training)
subjectQuant <- quantification(Quant)
```

which provides quantitative information for 72 proteins, including two
standard proteins, *AIAG-Bovine* and *FETUA-Bovine*. These proteins
were targeted for plasma samples with SRM with isotope labeled
reference peptides in order to identify candidate protein biomarker
for non-invasive detection of CRC. The training cohort included 100
subjects in control group and 100 subjects with CRC. Each sample for
subject was measured in a single injection without technical
replicate. The training cohort was analyzed with Skyline. The dataset
was already normalized as described in manuscript. User do not need
extra normalization. NAs should be considered as censored missing. Two
standard proteins can be removed for statistical analysis.


Then, clinical information where added.

diagnosis based on circulating plasma proteins*. EMBO Mol. Med., 7,
1166â€“1178 for details.
