# Using R and Bioconductor for MS-based proteomics

## Introduction

R and Bioconductor offer a range of dedicated packages for the
analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The advantage of such
technology-infrastructure is that offer specific behaviour for these
kind of data.

The `r Biocexptpkg("RforProteomics")` package provides a first
introduction to what is available. It is also possible to navigate the
*biocViews* hierarchy (these are tags that are used to describe
individual package's domain of action).

The highest level defines 3 types of packages:

- Software: packages providing a specific functionality.
- AnnotationData: packages providing annotations, such as various
  ontologies, species annotations, microarray annotations, ...
- ExperimentData: packages distributing experiments.

The *biocViews* that are relevant here are *Proteomcis*,
*MassSpectrometry* and *MassSpectrometryData*.

The *biocViews* page is available here

- https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software

It is most easily accessed by clicking on the *software packages* link
on the homepage, under *About Bioconductor*.

additional information.

Here, we will focus on the `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package, as it
supports all types of MS-based proteomics data and files that one
would generally encounter:

- Raw data
- Identification data
- Quantiative data

The respective types of data come in the form of

- `mzML` files (`mzXML` and `netCDF` are also supported)
- `mzIdentML` files (abbreviated `mzid`)
- Arbitrary spreadsheets or `mzTab` files

which can be read into R using

- `readMSData`
- `readMzIdData`
- `readMSnSet2` or `readMzTabData`

Once loaded in R, the data are stored as dedicated data structures

- `MSnExp` (an MS experiment)
- `data.frame`
- `MSnSet` (an MS expression set)


```{r summarytab, echo=FALSE}
tab <- data.frame(data = c("raw", "identification",
						   "quantitation", "quantitation"),
				  `file type` = c("mzML", "mzIdentML",
								  "spreadsheet", "mzTab"),
				  `function` = c("readMSData", "readMzIdData",
								 "readMSnSet2", "readMzTabdata"),
				  class = c("MSnExp", "data.frame", "MSnSet", "MSnSet"))
print(knitr::kable(tab))
```

To start, let's load the `MSnbase` package

```{r loadmsnbase}
library("MSnbase")
```

We will make use of test data that is provided by the experiment
package `r Biocexptpkg("msdata")`, that we load below. We then extract
the file names that will be used later on.

```{r}
library("msdata")
rawf <- proteomics(full.names = TRUE, pattern = "TMT11")
basename(rawf)
idf <- ident(full.names = TRUE)
basename(idf)
```

## Identification data

## Quantitative data
